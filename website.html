10-13-2020 As we all wait for the next few days up until October 17th when the biggest clash of 2020 in boxing will finally take place, the long awaited match between Teofimo Lopez clashing against double olympic gold medalist, 396-1 as an amateur, Vasily Lomachenko.
Many questions remain will Lopez's raw power and fast hands be enough to overcome Lomachenko's experience, footwork, movement and combinations? Is Lopez experienced enough to challenge the caliber of Lomachenko? Lopez's IBF belt and father would say so but this is easily debatable.
On a personal level I would put my money on Lomachenko but again that is only my humble opinion. This promises to possibly be a highlight reel fight. Fingers crossed.

    10-12-2020 On October 3rd of 2020 Jose Zepeda KOs Ivan Baranchyk in what could be a candidate for fight of the year. This is the kind of fight that all fans and people in attendance would get on the edge of their seats and jump screaming. A fight that any coach
    would hate to see his fighter in due to the insanity that was displayed. During what lasted 5 rounds, 8 knockdowns were scrored and the ultimate one being Zepeda passing the KO to Branchyk and an absolute brutal manner with a powerful left hook. Baranchyk then stayed for what seems like an
    eternity on the mat but finally got up after almost 10 minutes down. If you have 20 minutes to spare and are or not a boxing fan, please see take the time and watch this fight.
